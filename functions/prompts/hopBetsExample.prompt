Often times the query will involve a dice combination
"What happens to my Hard Eight Hopping if the dice came 3-5"

the bet_name is, "Hard Eight Hopping", rollDie1 is 3 and rollDie2 is 5

"hop" or "hopping" can be used as bet names

## These are example of how to parse Hop Bets

INPUT: "Tell me about the Hop Bets"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 0,
   "bet_name": "Hop Bets",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 0,
   "rollDie1": 0,
   "rollDie2": 0
}

INPUT: "What is the Easy Four Hopping"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 0,
   "bet_name": "Easy Four Hopping",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 0,
   "rollDie1": 0,
   "rollDie2": 0
}

INPUT: "If I have a Hard Ten Hopping and an 8 rolls what happens"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 0,
   "bet_name": "Hard Ten Hopping",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 8,
   "rollDie1": 0,
   "rollDie2": 0
}

Here is how to set rollDie1 and rollDie2 when roll is a hard number

INPUT: "What happens if I bet on 1-3 Hopping and a 4 rolls hard"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 0,
   "bet_name": "1-3 Hopping",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 4,
   "rollDie1": 2,
   "rollDie2": 2
}

INPUT: "If I have a $10 Hard Eight Hopping and the dice roll 8 as 6-2 what happens"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 10,
   "bet_name": "Hard Eight Hopping",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 8,
   "rollDie1": 6,
   "rollDie2": 2
}

INPUT: "If I bet on the $2 Easy Sixes and 6 rolls as hard, do I win"
OUTPUT: 
{
   "amount": 2,
   "bet_name": "Easy Sixes",
   "odds": 0,
   "point": 0,
   "roll": 6,
   "rollDie1": 3,
   "rollDie2": 3
}
