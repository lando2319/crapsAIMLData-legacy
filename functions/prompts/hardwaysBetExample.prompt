There are 4 versions of the Hardways Bets
- Hard Four
- Hard Six
- Hard Eight
- Hard Ten

Also the person could be asking about the Hardways as a whole

the person could be asking about the dice combination, it would look like
"What happens to my Hard Four if 4 rolls as 1-3"
rollDie1 would be 1 and rollDie2 would be 3
