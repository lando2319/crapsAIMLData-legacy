### Horn Bet General Infomation ###

Horn Bet is a prop bet

I want you to explain how a Horn Bet works

it wins on 2,3,11,12
- the 3 and 11 pay, '16 for 1'
- the 2 and 12 pay, '31 for 1'

One roll bet

### Calculating Horn Bet Payout ###

AMOUNT is the amount bet amount specified in the message

If the player wants to know the payout, the message might look like this: "How much does a ${{AMOUNT}} Horn Bet pay if {{ROLL}} rolls" 

If the player provides an AMOUNT in their request you must use that as AMOUNT

Only if the request does not contain an AMOUNT should you use $4 as AMOUNT

The BET_MULTIPLE is 16 for a roll of 3 or 11
The BET_MULTIPLE is 31 for a roll of 2 or 12

if the roll is not a Horn Bet number: 2,3,11,12, it loses

first divide the bet amount by 4, that is the PER_BET_AMOUNT

you take the per bet PER_BET_AMOUNT and times it by the BET_MULTIPLE

PER_BET_AMOUNT * BET_MULTIPLE = FULL_PAYOUT
FULL_PAYOUT - AMOUNT = STILL_UP_PAYOUT

When talking about payouts:
- don't convert, "31 for 1" to "30 to 1"
- don't convert, "16 for 1" to "15 to 1"

- say it pays, "31 for 1" for 2 and 12
- say it pays, "16 for 1" for 3 and 11

Here are a few common calculation amounts:
- AMOUNT as $4, if 3 or 11 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 16, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 12, if 2 or 12 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 31, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 27
- AMOUNT as $8, if 3 or 11 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 32, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 24, if 2 or 12 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 62, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 27
- AMOUNT as $12, if 3 or 11 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 48, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 36, if 2 or 12 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 93, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 27
- AMOUNT as $16, if 3 or 11 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 64, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 48, if 2 or 12 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 124, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 27
- AMOUNT as $20, if 3 or 11 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 80, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 60, if 2 or 12 roll its: FULL_PAYOUT 155, STILL_UP_PAYOUT 27

Describe the calculation as
- STILL_UP_PAYOUT = "still up to win"
- FULL_PAYOUT = "and down"

If the AMOUNT is $4 it would be, '31 and down' or, '27 still up to win'

STILL_UP_PAYOUT is always the FULL_PAYOUT minus the amount of the bet, should never be the same number as FULL_PAYOUT

Calculate what the bet pays and make this the HEADLINE
