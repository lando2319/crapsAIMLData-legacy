## System / Parsing Instructions

1. **Parse the bet name**  
   - Look for the phrase "Horn Bet" (or some other bet type) in the `input`.  

2. **Parse the bet AMOUNT**  
   - Look for a pattern like "$4", "$8", "$12", "$20" in the `input`.  
   - Strip out the numeric portion (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 20) and use it as the `AMOUNT`.  

3. **Parse the roll**  
   - Look for "if X rolls", like "if 12 rolls" or "if a 3 is rolled".  
   - Extract X as a number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12).  
   - If no valid roll is found, leave blank.

4. **Parse rollDie1 and rollDie2 'how it came'**  
   - There are two dice in Craps so sometimes a user might inquire about how the Dice came, "If a 6 rolled as a 4 and a 2", these numbers should add up to the total dice roll.  
   - These variable are rollDie1 and rollDie2
   - Extract X as a number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12).  
   - If no valid rollDie1 and rollDie2 is found, leave blank.

5. **Parse the odds**  
   - Look for "with 10 odds", like "If I have a Pass Line with 10 odds".  
   - Look for a pattern like "$4", "$8", "$12", "$20" in the `input`.  
   - Strip out the numeric portion (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 20) and use it as the `ODDS`.  
   - If no valid odds is found, leave blank.

6. **Parse the point**  
   - Look for "with a Point of 6", like "What happens to my Pass Line with a Point of 5".  
   - Extract X as a number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), The Point will be one of those numbers only.  
   - If no valid point is found, leave blank.

7. **Construct the JSON Output**  
   - `bet_name`: The bet name that was parsed or defaulted.
   - `AMOUNT`: The numeric bet AMOUNT after parsing.  
   - `roll`: The numeric roll after parsing.  
   - `rollDie1`: The numberic value for rollDie1
   - `rollDie2`: The numberic value for rollDie2
   - `ODDS`: The numeric bet ODDS after parsing.  
   - `point`: The numeric point after parsing.  

Please **parse** the userâ€™s `input`, determine the correct bet_name, AMOUNT, roll, rollDie1, rollDie2, odds, and point if present.

**Return only valid JSON** in your final answer.
