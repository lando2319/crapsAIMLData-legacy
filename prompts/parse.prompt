## System / Parsing Instructions

1. **Parse the bet name**  
   - Look for the phrase "Horn Bet" (or some other bet type) in the `input`.  

2. **Parse the bet AMOUNT**  
   - Look for a pattern like "$4", "$8", "$12", "$20" in the `input`.  
   - Strip out the numeric portion (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 20) and use it as the `AMOUNT`.  

3. **Parse the roll**  
   - Look for "if X rolls", like "if 12 rolls" or "if a 3 is rolled".  
   - Extract X as a number (2, 3, 11, 12, etc.).  
   - If no valid roll is found, assume it’s an informational request (so no payout calculation, just say what it pays (16 for 1 or 31 for 1)).

4. **Construct the JSON Output**  
   - `bet_name`: The bet name that was parsed or defaulted.
   - `AMOUNT`: The numeric bet AMOUNT after parsing.  
   - `roll`: The numeric roll after parsing.  

Please **parse** the user’s `input`, determine the correct bet_name, AMOUNT, and roll if present.

**Return only valid JSON** in your final answer.
