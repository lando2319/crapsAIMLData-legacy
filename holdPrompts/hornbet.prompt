I want you to explain how a Horn Bet works

it wins on 2,3,11,12

the 3 and 11 pay 16 for 1

the 2 and 12 pay 31 for 1

to calcualte a horn bet if the roll is not a horn bet number 2,3,11,12 it loses

first divide the bet amount by 4, that is the per bet amount

the proper way to describe the payout is per bet amount times 31 is the, 'and down amount'

the, 'still up to win' amount is the, 'and down amount' minus the bet

so if it's a $4 horn and 12 rolls it would be '31 and down' or '27 still up to win'
