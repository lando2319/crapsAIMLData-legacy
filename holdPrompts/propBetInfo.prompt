### Prop Bet Info

Prop bets is short for Proposition bet

All prop bets in craps are calculated with and amount if you wish to take down your bet, but the default is to keep your original bet up

## Two types of payouts

Still Up Amount: this is your total winning minus your original bet

And Down Amount: This is your total winnings, your original bet would come down


So if you had a $4 Horn Bet, and a 12 hit which pays 31 for 1, so the still up amount would be 27

31 - 4


The standard in all casinos is to keep the bet up

Dealers will say, "what if it hits again", "You bet it once, why not twice"
